# Algorithms && Data Structures (VK Education)

My solutions for the practical assignments from the VK Education course.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a log of my progress in the "Algorithms and Data Structures" course. The code is written in C++ and is subject to review by my mentor.

## Code Philosophy

Given the algorithmic nature of the course, the code is written with specific priorities in mind:

| Aspect | Status | Reason |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Algorithm Correctness** | **High Priority** | The main goal of the assignments. |
| **Code Efficiency** | **High Priority** | Focusing on time/space complexity. |
| **OOP Principles** | **Applied Occasionally** | Not the focus of the curriculum. |
| **Project Structure** | **Minimal** | Simplified for quick task navigation. |
| **Build System** | **Basic** | Set up for easy compilation per task. |

## Course Topics

The repository covers key computer science topics:
*   **Basic Structures:** Arrays, Lists, Stacks, Queues, Deques
*   **Searching:** Binary, Exponential, Ternary Search
*   **Sorting:** Fundamental and Advanced sorting algorithms
*   **Hash Tables** and **String Algorithms**
*   **Trees:** Search Trees, Red-Black Trees
*   **Graphs**
*   **Dynamic Programming**
